# Apple Silicon evidence

These runs use an Apple M5 Max with 128 GiB unified memory, macOS 26.5.2,
Python 3.12.13, and the pinned Qwen/Qwen3.5-4B checkpoint recorded in every
manifest. The Mac also had an unrelated local-model service resident; it was
left running. Timings describe this machine and workload, not an isolated
cross-hardware comparison with the published CUDA results.

## Storage and provenance

The 18 large row-level prediction and diagnostic reports are stored as
losslessly compressed `.json.gz` / `.jsonl.gz` files. Summaries, manifests,
CLI evidence, and this explanation remain plain text. No prediction fields,
precision, timings, or source hashes have been rewritten. These measurements
were collected under the former OpenJev name; historical commands and source
paths in the evidence intentionally retain that name.

The readers, verifier, quantization reference loader, and precision probe
accept either plain files or their `.gz` equivalents. New benchmark runs still
write plain, create-only outputs. To inspect a retained file:

```bash
gzip -dc results/mlx/2026-09-17-bf16-fixed/quality.json.gz
```

`SHA256SUMS` checks stored bytes; `UNCOMPRESSED_SHA256SUMS` preserves the original
hashes of all 30 retained run files. The gzip-aware reader that checked decoded
payloads (`benchmarks/mlx_evidence.py`) was removed with the Apple Silicon
backend; the uncompressed hashes are retained for future verification.

## Earlier experiments (summarized)

The incomplete and superseded raw runs are omitted from this tree. They remain
available at the [original evidence commit](https://github.com/fcoury/openjev/tree/56e7ce2a38214137f476d2444e9193f72dcbb4ab/results/mlx):

- `2026-09-17-bf16-pilot`: seven-decision pilot on MLX-LM 0.31.3; review
  thresholds frozen before full evaluation.
- `2026-09-17-bf16`: diagnostic and quality completed, but process exited 137
  during fresh shape scoring; no completed systems result.
- `2026-09-17-bf16-bounded`: full run with the 256 MiB allocator limit on the
  superseded runtime; also contains the before/after normalization probes.
- `2026-09-17-q8`: first 8-bit experiment on the superseded runtime;
  compact-generation arrays were incomplete.

The initial inactive-cache limit was approximately 122 GiB. The first run's
exit occurred while another model occupied substantial memory; memory pressure
is a likely explanation, not an independently confirmed OS diagnosis. With a
256 MiB inactive-cache limit, the full workload completed. The limit does not
cap active model or batch memory.

## Fixed-runtime BF16 results

All 252 quality decisions selected the same winning option as the published
Torch predictions: mean family-balanced accuracy was **81.32%** on authored144
and **77.99%** on perturbations108. Maximum probability differences from the
published predictions were 0.1052 and 0.0614 respectively. Prompt hashes and
input-token counts matched. One missing-evidence example selected a non-
insufficient answer with score at least 0.8.

The full shape workload is 37 states with 21 decisions per state. Each mode
has one warm measured pass over all 777 decisions, excluding model loading,
artifact hashing, initial warmup, and result writes. Timings include prompt
preparation and synchronized GPU execution through CPU readout.

| Mode | Total seconds | Decisions/s | Speedup vs fresh | Peak MLX GiB | Changed choices vs fresh |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| direct | 475.59 | 1.63 | 1.00x | 9.31 | 0 |
| serial | 66.84 | 11.62 | 7.12x | 9.29 | 3 |
| shared | 45.06 | 17.24 | 10.55x | 12.27 | 3 |

Serial and parallel modes each changed 3/777 choices. Every changed decision
involved a 0.5/0.5 tie in at least one execution shape. Maximum absolute
probability movement was 0.06713 for serial and 0.06028 for parallel. This is
measured speed with small numerical differences, not bit-identical reuse.
Peak MLX allocation includes model weights and intermediates, not total system
memory. The resident model itself used about 7.83 GiB; parallel batch
intermediates account for the higher peak.

The 21-decision compact-generation comparison produced valid JSON arrays in
all three repetitions and agreed with direct decisions on 18/21 questions.
Median direct shared scoring took **2.033 s**;
median generation took **2.718 s**
(1.34x as long). This separate short experiment
has its own timing variation; it is not the 777-decision throughput result.

## Precision investigation

The first complete run had 12 quality decisions exceeding the predeclared
0.05 probability-difference review threshold or changing their winning option.
The diagnostic selected exactly those cases and compared identical prompts and
source weights with PyTorch CPU FP32. This is an investigation of observed
failures, not a held-out quality evaluation.

MLX-LM 0.31.3 used RMS normalization with epsilon applied to a mean while the
reference L2 normalization applies epsilon to a sum. The pinned upstream
[fix](https://github.com/ml-explore/mlx-lm/commit/a63e24c389382619eb6d9af656e3b46024be217a)
corrects the scaling. The production dependency uses that maintained upstream
commit, with no local model fork or monkey patch.

| Maximum absolute probability difference over the selected 12 decisions | Original runtime | Fixed runtime |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| Native MLX weights cast to FP32 vs CPU FP32 | 0.109083 | 0.009402 |
| Source RMSNorm weights folded in FP32 vs CPU FP32 | 0.101279 | 0.007598 |

Evidence: [original probe](https://github.com/fcoury/openjev/blob/56e7ce2a38214137f476d2444e9193f72dcbb4ab/results/mlx/2026-09-17-bf16-bounded/precision-probe.json),
[fixed-runtime probe](https://github.com/fcoury/openjev/blob/56e7ce2a38214137f476d2444e9193f72dcbb4ab/results/mlx/2026-09-17-bf16-bounded/precision-upstream-fixed.json).
The second probe selects cases from the same original run, then recomputes
MLX predictions using the fixed runtime. Per-prediction metadata distinguishes
runtime and diagnostic transformations. Remaining differences are measured;
this does not establish numerical identity between Metal and PyTorch.

## Quantization results

Both quantized models start from the same BF16 source and use affine weight
quantization, group size 64. All 252 direct outputs had valid distributions.
The accuracy columns are mean family-balanced accuracy; changed choices are
measured against fresh BF16 MLX scoring, not against the gold labels.

| Precision | Authored144 | Perturbations108 | Changed choices: authored / perturbations | Peak MLX GiB during quality scoring |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| BF16 | 81.32% | 77.99% | 0 / 0 | 8.12 |
| Q8 | 81.85% | 76.58% | 2 / 4 | 4.66 |
| Q4 | 78.92% | 79.89% | 14 / 6 | 2.82 |

8-bit changed 6/252 decisions, with maximum probability movement of 0.1761.
4-bit changed 20/252, with maximum movement of 0.6776. These small authored
fixtures do not justify a general quality ranking; quantization is a measured
memory/behavior tradeoff. BF16 remains the default. The 4-bit option is useful
for memory experiments but substantially changes some distributions.

Both quantized models generated only 20 answers for 21 questions in all three
compact-generation repetitions. Their generation timings are retained as
failed-completion evidence, not equivalent-answer performance. The direct
path returned all requested decisions. Quantized tests cover the seven-case
cache diagnostic, 252 quality cases, and three 21-decision timing repetitions;
the complete 777-decision systems comparison was run only for BF16.

Evidence: [8-bit quality](2026-09-17-q8-fixed/quality.json.gz),
[4-bit quality](2026-09-17-q4-fixed/quality.json.gz),
[8-bit generation](2026-09-17-q8-fixed/generation.json.gz),
[4-bit generation](2026-09-17-q4-fixed/generation.json.gz).

## Interpretation

Direct output is a distribution over the supplied choices. It guarantees the
output shape, not a correct decision or calibrated confidence. Changes in
precision, kernel shape, prefix splitting, and batch size can move scores and
change close decisions. All observed winning-option changes are retained in
comparison reports. Neither the authored benchmark nor the shape workload is
a general model-quality qualification.

New evidence directories were create-only. Earlier experiments are summarized
above and accessible through the original evidence commit. The original CUDA summary and raw evidence are unchanged.

## Validation and integrity

The installed CLI was exercised in direct, serial, and shared modes with the
real pinned checkpoint; each returned the three expected decision IDs and
finite normalized distributions. Commands, raw outputs, comparisons, and
hashes are retained in [CLI validation](2026-09-17-cli-smoke/validation.json).

Validation originally covered the native tiny hybrid cache regressions, recurrent
normalization, and configurable allocation-cache limits. The three retained
final benchmark directories passed `benchmarks/verify_mlx.py`, which was removed
with the Apple Silicon backend. Original CUDA checksums and all 69
published-summary checks still pass. The retained Mac artifacts remain
byte-checkable with:

```bash
(cd results/mlx && shasum -a 256 -c SHA256SUMS)
```
